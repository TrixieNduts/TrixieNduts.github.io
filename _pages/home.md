This is my first portfolio.

My name is Beatrice Nduta. A network engineer in Kenya, I am a very big enthusiast of cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity has always sparked something inside me. I am currently undergoing a three-month training in Cybershujaa as a cybersecurity analyst, and I am loving this path.
This shall be the path I end up majoring in soon.
