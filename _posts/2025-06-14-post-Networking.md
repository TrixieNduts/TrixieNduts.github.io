A network enables two computers to communicate with each other. There is a wide array of topologies (mesh/tree/star), mediums (ethernet/fiber/coax/wireless), and protocols (TCP/UDP/IPX) that can be used to facilitate the network. It is important as security professionals to understand networking because when the network fails, the error may be silent, causing us to miss something.

Setting up a large, flat network is not extremely difficult, and it can be a reliable network, at least operationally. However, a flat network is like building a house on a land plot and considering it secure because it has a lock on the door. By creating lots of smaller networks and having them communicate, we can add defense layers. Pivoting around a network is not difficult, but doing it quickly and silently is tough and will slow attackers down.

Network Types
Each network is structured differently and can be set up individually. For this reason, so-called types and topologies have been developed that can be used to categorize these networks. When reading about all the types of networks, it can be a bit of information overload as some network types include the geographical range. We rarely hear some of the terminologies in practice, so this section will be broken up into Common Terms and Book Terms. Book terms are good to know, as there has been a single documented case of an email server failing to deliver emails longer than 500 miles but don't be expected to be able to recite them on demand unless you are studying for a networking exam.

Common Terminology
Network Type	Definition
Wide Area Network (WAN)	Internet
Local Area Network (LAN)	Internal Networks (Ex: Home or Office)
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)	Internal Networks accessible over Wi-Fi
Virtual Private Network (VPN)	Connects multiple network sites to one LAN

Network topologies are divided into the following eight basic types:

Point-to-Point	Bus
Star	Ring
Mesh	Tree
Hybrid	Daisy Chain

Networking Models
Two networking models describe the communication and transfer of data from one host to another, called ISO/OSI model and the TCP/IP model. This is a simplified representation of the so-called layers representing transferred Bits in readable contents for us.
