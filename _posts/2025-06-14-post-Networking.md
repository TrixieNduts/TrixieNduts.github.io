A network enables two computers to communicate with each other. There is a wide array of topologies (mesh/tree/star), mediums (ethernet/fiber/coax/wireless), and protocols (TCP/UDP/IPX) that can be used to facilitate the network. It is important as security professionals to understand networking because when the network fails, the error may be silent, causing us to miss something.

Setting up a large, flat network is not extremely difficult, and it can be a reliable network, at least operationally. However, a flat network is like building a house on a land plot and considering it secure because it has a lock on the door. By creating lots of smaller networks and having them communicate, we can add defense layers. Pivoting around a network is not difficult, but doing it quickly and silently is tough and will slow attackers down.
