This is a link to my web application finished project.

Web applications are interactive applications that run on web browsers. Web applications usually adopt a client-server architecture to run and handle interactions. They typically have front end components (i.e., the website interface, or "what the user sees") that run on the client-side (browser) and other back end components (web application source code) that run on the server-side (back end server/databases).

This allows organizations to host powerful applications with near-complete real-time control over their design and functionality while being accessible worldwide. Some examples of typical web applications include online email services like Gmail, online retailers like Amazon, and online word processors like Google Docs
